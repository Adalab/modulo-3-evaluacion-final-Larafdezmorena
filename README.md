# Project Title

Harry Potter

## Description

In this project, we have developed a web application that allows you to search for characters from the magical world of Harry Potter. You can perform searches by filtering by name and house. This project is primarily built with React. The data used for this exercise was obtained from an API we found at https://hp-api.onrender.com/.
